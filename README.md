npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev  # Starts on port 3001
```

### 2. SwitchPrint Service Setup
```bash
cd backend/python_bridge
pip install switchprint  # Install SwitchPrint by Aahad Vakani
./start_service.sh       # Starts on port 5001
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Configure NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
npm run dev  # Starts on port 3000
```

### 4. Verify Integration
```bash
# Test SwitchPrint integration
cd backend
node --import tsx/esm src/scripts/testSwitchPrintIntegration.ts
```

## API Endpoints

### SwitchPrint-Powered Analysis
```bash
# Real-time analysis (85.98% accuracy, 80x faster)
POST /api/live-analysis
{
  "text": "Hello, ¿cómo estás today?",
  "languages": ["English", "Spanish"],
  "includeDetails": true
}

# Enhanced example submission
POST /api/examples
{
  "text": "Je suis très busy today",
  "languages": ["French", "English"],
  "context": "Professional conversation"
}

# Performance monitoring
GET /api/live-analysis/stats
# Returns: SwitchPrint availability, performance metrics, engine status
```

### Research Analytics
```bash
GET /api/dashboard/metrics        # Overall statistics
GET /api/dashboard/language-pairs # Language pair analysis  
GET /api/dashboard/platforms      # Platform distribution
GET /api/dashboard/regions        # Regional statistics
```
